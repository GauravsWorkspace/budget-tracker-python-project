The Budget Tracker is a Python application designed to help users track their income, expenses, and monitor their budget. It allows users to add transactions (both income and expenses), categorize them, and view their current budget status. The application calculates the remaining budget and provides summaries of income, expenses, and balance over time.

Features:

Track Income and Expenses: Allows users to input both income and expenses with a specified category (e.g., "Food", "Transportation", etc.).

Budget Management: Set a monthly budget limit and track whether you are staying within the limit.

Transaction Categories: Expenses and income can be categorized for better tracking.

Balance Calculation: The application automatically calculates the balance (income - expenses).

Reports and Summaries: View reports by category, date, and overall summaries.

File Persistence: Data is stored in a CSV file for persistence between sessions.

User-Friendly Interface: Command-line interface for interacting with the app
